# forgor-privacypolicy
Forgor is a minimalist notes app.

I have programmed this app to NOT collect any personally identifiable information. This app doesn't send any data anywhere. It saves all the data on your local device.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely help you.

Yours sincerely
